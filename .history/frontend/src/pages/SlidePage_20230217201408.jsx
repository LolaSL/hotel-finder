              Dining, shopping, and nightlife opportunities abound in the
              coastal beach city of Tel Aviv, which in many ways can feel like
              the American city of Miami. You will see vibrant graffiti art,
              modern architecture as well as the largest collection of Bauhaus
              buildings in the world, and plenty of boutiques selling everything
              from textiles to home goods to clothing to furniture. Walk along
              the beach promenade or take a tour of the area via bicycle or
              Segway. Be sure to visit Carmel Market to sample different types
              of Israeli foods and drinks, influenced by a multitude of
              cultures. Explore the winding and narrow streets of Jaffa Old
              City, also known as Yafo, and its port. The contrast of the oldest
              port in the world, home to multiethnic communities, next to the
              modern city of Tel Aviv is stark. See the Jaffa Clock Tower, Saint
              Nicholas Monastery, the Great Mahmoudiya Mosque, the Old Jaffa
              Museum of Antiquities, and several gardens, squares, and
              courtyards.

              The walled and historic Old City of Jerusalem has been at the
              epicenter for religious faith, sacred to millions of people for
              thousands of years. Tourists, entering through one of seven
              entrances (the New Gate, Damascus Gate, Herod’s Gate, Lions’ Gate,
              Dung Gate, Zion Gate, and Jaffa Gate), explore the four uneven
              quarters—Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Armenian—within the stone
              walls. Visit religious sites, look for goods throughout the many
              stalls in the quarters, and dine out in any of the various
              eateries. The top must-see sites to experience here are the
              Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and Temple Mount.

              Located in east Jerusalem, near the Old City, Mount of Olives is a
              worthwhile place to visit to gain perspective of the land—you can
              see far and wide over the Kidron Valley to Jerusalem and Temple
              Mount when standing on this mountain. Olive groves once covered
              this Jewish burial ground, which has been the resting place for
              notable Jewish biblical figures for thousands of years. Dome of
              the Ascension, where Jesus is said to have made his last footprint
              on Earth, is located in these hills as is the Garden of
              Gethsemane, where Jesus prayed before crucifixion.

                Never trust bargains. Always carefully check what is included in

                With this option your room could cost 5%-10% more, but in the
                long run you will notice the difference. Surely you will have
                more flexibility with the dates. Also, if you end up finding
                something cheaper you have the option to cancel the previous
                reservation and book the cheapest one. Some hotels offer you the
                option to cancel your reservation on the same day of your
                arrival. Despite this, do not forget to carefully read about
                cancellation policies!

                price for public transports. If the price is high, maybe your
                best decisions is to stay in the city centre area. If the
                bus/metro tickets are cheap then you expand your visit in more
                rural areas and reach them by public transports.

                Could be that this piece of advice is not for everyone, but
                still we believe it could be a game changer. Usually Friday
                nights are the most expensive nights of the week. People usually
                take advantage of weekends and just pull up the prices. Try to
                start your trip in the early hours of Saturday. You can always
                leave your bags at the reception desk and check in later after
                you visited the city.
