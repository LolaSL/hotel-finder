              We know already that you would love to stay in a 5-star hotel,
              with Jacuzzi and breathtaking views of the Eiffel Tower. The
              question is, can you afford it? Make sure to calculate well your
              budget. Or just look at your bank account.

              It could happen that you have no choice but to organize your trip
              during August, Easter or Christmas holidays. Of course during this
              time your journey becomes more expensive. If you have the power to
              choose, then do not travel during this time. The difference
              between traveling in September instead of August can be seen from
              your wallet. Think about it!

              What are you looking for in this trip? Are you seeking to relax by
              yourself, is it going to be a trip with your colleagues or are you
              just looking for a quick weekend getaway? Depending on what you
              are looking for choose wisely the type of accommodation you will
              be staying in.

              7. Cheap can sometimes be expensive
            </h2>
            <article>
              Never trust bargains. Always carefully check what is included in
              your room price. Does it make sense to pay for a accommodation
              that does not provide WI-FI, breakfast or airport transfer? Most
              likely some of these services are key to you.

            <article>
              With this option your room could cost 5%-10% more, but in the long
              run you will notice the difference. Surely you will have more
              flexibility with the dates. Also, if you end up finding something
              cheaper you have the option to cancel the previous reservation and
              book the cheapest one. Some hotels offer you the option to cancel
              your reservation on the same day of your arrival. Despite this, do
              not forget to carefully read about cancellation policies!

            <article>
              Look up on the internet for forums or ask around what is the price
              for public transports. If the price is high, maybe your best
              decisions is to stay in the city centre area. If the bus/metro
              tickets are cheap then you expand your visit in more rural areas
              and reach them by public transports.

              10. Spend more than one night in the same area.
            </h2>
            <article>
              You will probably think: “Why should I spend more nights in the
              same place?”. It is simple. Many hotels offer “third/fourth free
              night” promotions. If your plan was to move around, then think
              carefully.

            <article>
              Concerts, or events such as St. Patrick in Dublin or the
              Oktoberfest in Munich are situations that can drastically increase
              the price of your accommodation. We recommend you to check the
              area you would like to visit if there are any events occurring so
              you can plan well your stay.

                    <article>
                Could be that this piece of advice is not for everyone, but
                still we believe it could be a game changer. Usually Friday
                nights are the most expensive nights of the week. People usually
                take advantage of weekends and just pull up the prices. Try to
                start your trip in the early hours of Saturday. You can always
                leave your bags at the reception desk and check in later after
                you visited the city.

                This is key when you are organizing your trip . Always look at
                the opinions that former guests gave to hotels. Price is not
                everything. Their opinion can be your guide to decide your
                perfect accommodation. But be careful! Do not become obsessed by
                them.
