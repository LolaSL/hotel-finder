            Visitors traveling to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, or any of Israels other
            popular locales will fly into the country busiest and biggest
            airport, Ben Gurion Airport, named after the first Prime Minister.
            (Ramon Airport, the second largest in southern Israel, serves
            civilian traffic and operates as a diversion airport.) Also known as
            Tel Aviv Airport or Natbag, Ben Gurion Airport is located in the
            city of Lod, 28 miles northwest of Jerusalem and 12 miles southeast
            of Tel Aviv. A hub for El Al Israel Airlines, Israir Airlines,
            Arkia, and Sun D"Or, this airport is counted in the top five best
            airports in the Middle East due to security and passenger experience
            (you will notice armed Israel Police officers, Israel Defense
            Forces, and Israel Border Police as you make your way through the
            airport). Terminals 1 and 3 are the main gateways for passengers
            flying in and out of Israel, though the latter is mostly for
            domestic travel. Keep reading to learn more about the airport's
            amenities, public transportation to and from the airport, and other
            must-know tidbits.

            Built in the 1930s by the British Mandate, this airport saw major
            changes in the 1970s when Israel Airport Authorities (IAA) took
            control. By the 1990s, airport traffic was so busy that in 2004,
            Terminal 3 was created to accommodate the more than 25 million
            international passengers. Meanwhile, Terminal 2 served domestic
            flights until 2007 before it was removed entirely. Terminal 1, the
            old terminal, serves domestic flights and low-cost European
            international flights. Terminals 1 and 3 are connected through a
            complimentary shuttle bus. It is important to note that the security
            at Ben Gurion Airport may take longer than what you have experienced
            at other international airports due to ongoing tensions that Israel
            has had to face over the decades. It is advised to arrive at the
            airport a minimum of three hours prior to international travel to be
            safe, especially during Jewish holidays or peak times. You can
            expect to go through multiple check points, be asked security
            questions, and have your luggage examined. When passing through
            passport security, please note that you will be given a stamp on a
            small piece of paper in lieu of a passport book stamp. You will need
            to keep this piece of stamped paper safe and secure for the duration
            of your time in Israel. To avoid long wait times at security,
            passport control, and luggage screenings, you can book the VIP
            Departure Assistance or VIP Arrival Assistance services, which will
            expedite the process and include an airport steward to walk you
            through the airport security.
