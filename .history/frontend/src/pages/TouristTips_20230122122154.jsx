            1. Calculate your budget We know already that you would love to stay
            in a 5-star hotel, with Jacuzzi and breathtaking views of the Eiffel
            Tower. The question is, can you afford it? Make sure to calculate
            well your budget. Or just look at your bank account.

            2. Travel during low season It could happen that you have no choice
            but to organize your trip during August, Easter or Christmas
            holidays. Of course during this time your journey becomes more
            expensive. If you have the power to choose, then don’t travel during
            this time. The difference between traveling in September instead of
            August can be seen from your wallet. Think about it!

            3. Don’t forget it is your trip What are you looking for in this
            trip? Are you seeking to relax by yourself, is it going to be a trip
            with your colleagues or are you just looking for a quick weekend
            getaway? Depending on what you are looking for choose wisely the
            type of accommodation you will be staying in.

            4. What type of accommodation do you prefer? This point goes hand in
            hand with the previous one. It is not like before where hotels were
            the only option; now you can choose between hostels, apartments, B &
            B and cottages. Choose which one suits you the most.

            5. Bear in mind what accommodations can offer Are you looking for a
            hotel where you can rent bikes, a cosy spa or heated pool or an
            accommodation suitable for children? Compare each hotel in the area
            and find the one that completes the requirements you are looking
            for.

            6. Meals during the trip Are you organizing a trip with friends or a
            simple weekend gateway? Do you really need a full accommodation?
            Maybe you are just looking for a “spiritual” retreat in which you
            just want to leave your room to eat in the hotel’s dining room.
            Think about it and decide what suits you best.

            7. Cheap can sometimes be expensive Never trust bargains. Always
            carefully check what is included in your room price. Does it make
            sense to pay for a accommodation that does not provide WI-FI,
            breakfast or airport transfer? Most likely some of these services
            are key to you.

            8. Always book in advance and with the refund option With this
            option your room could cost 5%-10% more, but in the long run you
            will notice the difference. Surely you will have more flexibility
            with the dates. Also, if you end up finding something cheaper you
            have the option to cancel the previous reservation and book the
            cheapest one. Some hotels offer you the option to cancel your
            reservation on the same day of your arrival. Despite this, don’t
            forget to carefully read about cancellation policies!

            9. Find out the cost of public transports Look up on the internet
            for forums or ask around what is the price for public transports. If
            the price is high, maybe your best decisions is to stay in the city
            centre area. If the bus/metro tickets are cheap then you expand your
            visit in more rural areas and reach them by public transports.

            10. Spend more than one night in the same area You will probably
            think: “Why should I spend more nights in the same place?”. It is
            simple. Many hotels offer “third/fourth free night” promotions. If
            your plan was to move around, then think carefully.

            11. Check if there are any important events in the area during your
            stay Concerts, or events such as St. Patrick in Dublin or the
            Oktoberfest in Munich are situations that can drastically increase
            the price of your accommodation. We recommend you to check the area
            you would like to visit if there are any events occurring so you can
            plan well your stay.

            12. Forget about Friday Night Could be that this piece of advice is
            not for everyone, but still we believe it could be a game changer.
            Usually Friday nights are the most expensive nights of the week.
            People usually take advantage of weekends and just pull up the
            prices. Try to start your trip in the early hours of Saturday. You
            can always leave your bags at the reception desk and check in later
            after you visited the city.

            13. Ratings and opinions are important This is key when you are
            organizing your trip . Always look at the opinions that former
            guests gave to hotels. Price is not everything. Their opinion can be
            your guide to decide your perfect accommodation. But be careful!
            Don’t become obsessed by them.

            14. Search for promotional codes on the internet Many hotels offer
            some space on their reservation page where you can include a
            promotional code which can help you to save some money. Where can
            you find these codes? You will have to look for them online. We
            recommend you to download the app Honey.

            15. Sign up for newsletters Do you want to be the first one to know
            about any discounts? The best way to stay informed with this is by
            subscribing to newsletters. If a hotel launches new promotions and
            offers, the newsletter will always inform you about them.
