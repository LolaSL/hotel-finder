Meanwhile, Terminal 2 served domestic flights until 2007 before it was removed entirely. Terminal 1, the old terminal, serves domestic flights and low-cost European international flights. Terminals 1 and 3 are connected through a complimentary shuttle bus. It is important to note that the security at Ben Gurion Airport may take longer than what you have experienced at other international airports due to ongoing tensions that Israel has had to face over the decades. It is advised to arrive at the airport a minimum of three hours prior to international travel to be safe, especially during Jewish holidays or peak times. You can expect to go through multiple check points, be asked security questions, and have your luggage examined. When passing through passport security, please note that you will be given a stamp on a small piece of paper in lieu of a passport book stamp. You will need to keep this piece of stamped paper safe and secure for the duration of your time in Israel. To avoid long wait times at security, passport control, and luggage screenings, you can book the VIP Departure Assistance or VIP Arrival Assistance services, which will expedite the process and include an airport steward to walk you through the airport security.\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 100,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n          className: \"mb-4 mt-4\",\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h2\", {\n            className: \"font-weight-light display-4 text-center mt-4 mb-4\",\n            children: \"Ben Gurion Airport Parking\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 127,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"img\", {\n            src: \"./images/49.jpg\",\n            alt: \"Ben Gurion Airport Parking\",\n            className: \"img-thumbnail image rounded mx-auto d-block\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 130,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 126,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"article\", {\n          className: \"font-weight-light\",\n          children: [\"Short and long-term parking are both available at the airport, and can be purchased with a credit card or Israeli currency.

A hub for El Al Israel Airlines, Israir Airlines,\r\n            Arkia, and Sun D\"Or, this airport is counted in the top five best\r\n            airports in the Middle East due to security and passenger experience\r\n            (you will notice armed Israel Police officers, Israel Defense\r\n            Forces, and Israel Border Police as you make your way through the\r\n            airport). Terminals 1 and 3 are the main gateways for passengers\r\n            flying in and out of Israel, though the latter is mostly for\r\n            domestic travel.

By the 1990s, airport traffic was so busy that in 2004,\r\n            Terminal 3 was created to accommodate the more than 25 million\r\n            international passengers. Meanwhile, Terminal 2 served domestic\r\n            flights until 2007 before it was removed entirely. Terminal 1, the\r\n            old terminal, serves domestic flights and low-cost European\r\n            international flights. Terminals 1 and 3 are connected through a\r\n            complimentary shuttle bus. It is important to note that the security\r\n            at Ben Gurion Airport may take longer than what you have experienced\r\n            at other international airports due to ongoing tensions that Israel\r\n            has had to face over the decades. It is advised to arrive at the\r\n            airport a minimum of three hours prior to international travel to be\r\n            safe, especially during Jewish holidays or peak times. You can\r\n            expect to go through multiple check points, be asked security\r\n            questions, and have your luggage examined. When passing through\r\n            passport security, please note that you will be given a stamp on a\r\n            small piece of paper in lieu of a passport book stamp. You will need\r\n            to keep this piece of stamped paper safe and secure for the duration\r\n            of your time in Israel. To avoid long wait times at security,\r\n            passport control, and luggage screenings, you can book the VIP\r\n            Departure Assistance or VIP Arrival Assistance services, which will\r\n            expedite the process and include an airport steward to walk you\r\n            through the airport security.\r\n          </article>\r\n          <div className=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\r\n            <h2 className=\"font-weight-light display-4 text-center mt-4 mb-4\">\r\n              Ben Gurion Airport Parking\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <img\r\n              src=\"./images/49.jpg\"\r\n              alt=\"Ben Gurion Airport Parking\"\r\n              className=\"img-thumbnail image rounded mx-auto d-block\"\r\n            />\r\n          </div>\r\n          <article className=\"font-weight-light\">\r\n            Short and long-term parking are both available at the airport, and\r\n            can be purchased with a credit card or Israeli currency.
