Calculate your budget.</h2>  We know already that you would love to stay\r\n            in a 5-star hotel, with Jacuzzi and breathtaking views of the Eiffel\r\n            Tower. The question is, can you afford it? Make sure to calculate\r\n            well your budget.

Of course during this time your journey becomes more\r\n            expensive. If you have the power to choose, then don’t travel during\r\n            this time. The difference between traveling in September instead of\r\n            August can be seen from your wallet.

It is not like before where hotels were\r\n            the only option; now you can choose between hostels, apartments, B &\r\n            B and cottages.

Cheap can sometimes be expensive</h2> Never trust bargains. Always\r\n            carefully check what is included in your room price. Does it make\r\n            sense to pay for a accommodation that does not provide WI-FI,\r\n            breakfast or airport transfer? Most likely some of these services\r\n            are key to you.\r\n          </article>\r\n          <article>\r\n          <div className=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\r\n              <img src=\"./images/6.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast\" className=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\" />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <h2>\r\n            8.

Surely you will have more flexibility\r\n            with the dates. Also, if you end up finding something cheaper you\r\n            have the option to cancel the previous reservation and book the\r\n            cheapest one. Some hotels offer you the option to cancel your\r\n            reservation on the same day of your arrival. Despite this, don’t\r\n            forget to carefully read about cancellation policies!\r\n          </article>\r\n          <article>\r\n          <div className=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\r\n              <img src=\"./images/7.jpg\" alt=\"Public transportation\" className=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\" />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <h2>\r\n            9. Find out the cost of public transports.</h2> Look up on the internet\r\n            for forums or ask around what is the price for public transports. If\r\n            the price is high, maybe your best decisions is to stay in the city\r\n            centre area. If the bus/metro tickets are cheap then you expand your\r\n            visit in more rural areas and reach them by public transports.\r\n          </article>\r\n          <article>\r\n            <h2>\r\n            10.

Many hotels offer “third/fourth free night” promotions. If\r\n            your plan was to move around, then think carefully.\r\n          </article>\r\n          <article>\r\n            <h2>\r\n            11. Check if there are any important events in the area during your\r\n            stay.</h2> Concerts, or events such as St. Patrick in Dublin or the\r\n            Oktoberfest in Munich are situations that can drastically increase\r\n            the price of your accommodation. We recommend you to check the area\r\n            you would like to visit if there are any events occurring so you can\r\n            plan well your stay.\r\n          </article>\r\n          <article>\r\n          <div className=\"mb-4 mt-4\">\r\n              <img src=\"./images/8.jpg\" alt=\"Party\" className=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\" />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <h2>\r\n            12. Forget about Friday Night.</h2> Could be that this piece of advice is\r\n            not for everyone, but still we believe it could be a game changer.\r\n            Usually Friday nights are the most expensive nights of the week.\r\n            People usually take advantage of weekends and just pull up the\r\n            prices. Try to start your trip in the early hours of Saturday. You\r\n            can always leave your bags at the reception desk and check in later\r\n            after you visited the city.\r\n          </article>\r\n          <article>\r\n            <h2>\r\n            13. Ratings and opinions are important.</h2> This is key when you are\r\n            organizing your trip . Always look at the opinions that former\r\n            guests gave to hotels. Price is not everything. Their opinion can be\r\n            your guide to decide your perfect accommodation. But be careful!\r\n            Do not become obsessed by them.\r\n          </article>\r\n          <article>\r\n            <h2>\r\n            14. Search for promotional codes on the internet.</h2> Many hotels offer\r\n            some space on their reservation page where you can include a\r\n            promotional code which can help you to save some money. Where can\r\n            you find these codes? You will have to look for them online.
